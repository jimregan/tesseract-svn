#summary Installing Tesseract from Subversion

These are instructions for installing Tesseract from the Subversion repository.  You need to do that right now if you want to build OCRopus.  For other purposes, you may simply want to download a tar ball.

= Installing Without Autoconf Tools =

You may be able to simply install the SVN version of Tesseract by using:

{{{
    svn checkout http://tesseract-ocr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tesseract-ocr
    ./configure
    make
    make install
}}}

However, this may also fail (we're occasionally generating the ./configure script and checking it in, but we're not testing it very much).  

If it fails, you should generate your own configure script from autoconf tools, as described in the next section.

= Installing With Autoconf Tools =

In order to do this, you must have aclocal, autoheader, autoconf, and automake installed.  

On Debian or Ubuntu, you can probably do that with:

{{{
    apt-get install autoconf automake
}}}

Afterwards, the steps for installing the SVN version of Tesseract, do this:

{{{
    svn checkout http://tesseract-ocr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tesseract-ocr
    cd tesseract-ocr
    ./runautoconf
    ./configure
    make
    make install
}}}
