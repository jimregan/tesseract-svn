= Can't read compressed Tiff files =

I get this error message:
{{{
read_tif_image:Error:Illegal image format:Compression
}}}

Windows:
Libtiff support can be added in either VC++6 or VC++Express with the following:

{{{
Goto http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/tiff.htm
Download and run the setup program.
Add the paths for include and library files in tools/options/directories
Add HAVE_LIBTIFF to the preprocessor definitions.
Add libtiff.lib to the list of libraries.
Rebuild.
Make libtiff3.dll be in your path somewhere.
This is done by control panel/system/advanced/environment variables and adding c:/program files/gnuwin32/bin to PATH.
Keep your fingers crossed...
}}}

Non-Windows: Install libtiff. Procedure differs from OS to OS, but on many something like
{{{
sudo apt-get install libtiff-dev
}}}
or some variant thereof should do the trick, before running configure.
