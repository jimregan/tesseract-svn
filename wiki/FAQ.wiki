A collection of frequently asked questions and the answers, or pointers to them.


= Can't read compressed Tiff files =

I get this error message:
{{{
read_tif_image:Error:Illegal image format:Compression
}}}

Windows:
Libtiff support can be added in either VC++6 or VC++Express with the following:

{{{
Goto http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/tiff.htm
Download and run the setup program.
Add the paths for include and library files in tools/options/directories
Add HAVE_LIBTIFF to the preprocessor definitions.
Add libtiff.lib to the list of libraries.
Rebuild.
Make libtiff3.dll be in your path somewhere.
This is done by control panel/system/advanced/environment variables and adding c:/program files/gnuwin32/bin to PATH.
Keep your fingers crossed...
}}}

Non-Windows: Install libtiff. Procedure differs from OS to OS, but on many something like
{{{
sudo apt-get install libtiff-dev
}}}
or some variant thereof should do the trick, before running configure.

= No output with color images =

There have been several bug reports of blank or garbage output with color images, both with and without libtiff. Here is the most up-to-date information (last update 23 Sep 2008):

Without libtiff, Tesseract only reads uncompressed tiff files. Even then it won't read 32 bit tiff files correctly. Will be fixed in 2.04.

With libtiff, Tesseract reads compressed tiff files, but can't handle *any* color: 24 or 32 bit. It can only read 1 bit binary images or 8 bit greyscale. (No color maps!) Will be fixed in 2.04.

The API (TessBaseAPI) should be OK with 1, 8, 24 or 32 bit images.

= Does it support multi-page tiff files? =

Only with 2.03 and later, and only if you have libtiff installed. See Compressed Tiff above.

= How do I Edit Box files used in training? =

Use bbtesseract. See http://code.google.com/p/bbtesseract/ and http://groups.google.com/group/bbtesseract

Alternatively,  http://code.google.com/p/wx-tetra/ has another application for editing box files.

= How do I recognize only digits? =

Use
{{{
TessBaseAPI::SetVariable("tessedit_char_whitelist", "0123456789");
}}}
BEFORE calling an Init function or put this in a text file called `tessdata/configs/digits`:
{{{
tessedit_char_whitelist 0123456789
}}}
and then your command line becomes:
{{{
tesseract image.tif outputbase nobatch digits
}}}
*Warning:* Until the old and new config variables get merged, you *must* have the `nobatch` parameter too.

= How do I provide my own dictionary? =

Easy: Replace `tessdata/eng.user-words` with your own word list, in the same format - UTF8 text, one word per line.

More difficult, but better for a large dictionary: Replace `tessdata/eng.word-dawg` with one created from your own word list, using wordlist2dawg. See the TrainingTesseract wiki page for details.

= Is there a Minimum Text Size? (It won't read screen text!) =

There is a minimum text size for reasonable accuracy. You have to consider resolution as well as point size. Accuracy drops off below 10pt x 300dpi, rapidly below 8pt x 300dpi. A quick check is to count the pixels of the x-height of your characters. (X-height is the height of the lower case x.) At 10pt x 300dpi x-heights are typically about 20 pixels, although this can vary dramatically from font to font. Below an x-height of 10 pixels, you have very little chance of accurate results, and below about 8 pixels, most of the text will be "noise removed".

= How do I generate the language data files? =

Read the TrainingTesseract wiki.


= My question isn't in here! =

Try searching the forum: http://groups.google.com/group/tesseract-ocr as your question may have come up before even if it is not listed here.
