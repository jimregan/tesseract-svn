= Can't read compressed Tiff files =

I get this error message:
{{{
read_tif_image:Error:Illegal image format:Compression
}}}

Windows:
Libtiff support can be added in either VC++6 or VC++Express with the following:

{{{
Goto http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/tiff.htm
Download and run the setup program.
Add the paths for include and library files in tools/options/directories
Add HAVE_LIBTIFF to the preprocessor definitions.
Add libtiff.lib to the list of libraries.
Rebuild.
Make libtiff3.dll be in your path somewhere.
This is done by control panel/system/advanced/environment variables and adding c:/program files/gnuwin32/bin to PATH.
Keep your fingers crossed...
}}}

Non-Windows: Install libtiff. Procedure differs from OS to OS, but on many something like
{{{
sudo apt-get install libtiff-dev
}}}
or some variant thereof should do the trick, before running configure.

= How do I Edit Box files used in training? =

Use bbtesseract. See http://code.google.com/p/bbtesseract/ and http://groups.google.com/group/bbtesseract

= How do I recognize only digits? =

Use
{{{
TessBaseAPI::SetVariable("tessedit_char_whitelist", "0123456789");
}}}
BEFORE calling an Init function.

= How do I provide my own dictionary? =

Easy: Replace `tessdata/eng.user-words` with your own word list, in the same format - UTF8 text, one word per line.

More difficult, but better for a large dictionary: Replace `tessdata/eng.word-dawg` with one created from your own word list, using wordlist2dawg. See the TrainingTesseract wiki page for details.

= My question isn't in here! =

Try searching the forum: http://groups.google.com/group/tesseract-ocr as your question may have come up before even if it is not listed here.
