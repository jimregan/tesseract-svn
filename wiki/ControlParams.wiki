#summary A list of useful control parameters and config files.

= Introduction =

Tesseract is extremely flexible, if you know how to control it. There is a large number of control parameters to modify its behaviour. While these change from time to time, most of them are fairly stable.

There are (at least) 3 different types:

===Init only.===
Eg load_system_dawg, characterized by *INIT* in its initialization macro.
These parameters can *only* be set at the {{{ TessBaseAPI::Init }}} function that takes a list of config files.

The rest can be set through {{{ TessBaseAPI::SetVariable }}} and make 2 further groups:

===General parameters:===
Control many different aspects of Tesseract's functionality.

===Debug parameters:===
Contain debug in their name, control huge amounts of optional debug text and graphical output as Tesseract works.


= Details =

{{{ load_system_dawg }}} (Init only) controls whether or not to load the main dictionary for the selected language.

{{{ user_words_suffix }}} (Init only) the extension of the users-words word list file. If non-empty, it will attempt to load the relevant list of words to add to the dictionary for the selected language. Eg if set to {{{ user-words }}} Tesseract will attempt to load {{{ eng.user-words }}} from the tessdata directory at initialization time.

If you find a parameter that you consider useful, please add a comment to this page, and we will copy it into the page as we find it.
