#summary A list of useful control parameters and config files.

= Introduction =

Tesseract is extremely flexible, if you know how to control it. There is a large number of control parameters to modify its behaviour. While these change from time to time, most of them are fairly stable.

There are 3 different types:

===Init only===
Characterized by *INIT* in its initialization macro.
These parameters can *only* be set at the {{{ TessBaseAPI::Init }}} function that takes a list of config files.

The rest can be set through {{{ TessBaseAPI::SetVariable }}} and make 2 further groups:

===General parameters:===
Control many different aspects of Tesseract's functionality.

===Debug parameters:===
Contain debug in their name, control huge amounts of optional debug text and graphical output as Tesseract works.


= Useful parameters =

Note that the default value may change; check the source code if you need to be sure of it.

|| *Name* || *Type* || *Default value* || *Init only* || *Description* ||
|| {{{ load_system_dawg }}} || boolean (0/1) || 1 || Yes || Controls whether or not to load the main dictionary for the selected language. ||
|| {{{ user_words_suffix }}} || string || "" || Yes || The extension of the users-words word list file. If non-empty, it will attempt to load the relevant list of words to add to the dictionary for the selected language. Eg if set to {{{ user-words }}} Tesseract will attempt to load {{{ eng.user-words }}} from the tessdata directory at initialization time. ||
|| {{{ language_model_penalty_non_dict_word }}} || double (0-1) || 0.15 || No || The penalty to apply to words not in the word_dawg / user_words wordlists. ||
|| {{{ language_model_penalty_non_freq_dict_word }}} || double (0-1) || 0.1 || No || The penalty to apply to words not in the freq_dawg wordlist. ||

If you find a parameter that you consider useful, please add a comment to this page, and we will copy it into the page as we find it.
