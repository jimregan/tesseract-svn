= Tesseract release notes May 15, 2007 - V1.04. =

*Windows users only*
Added a dll interface for windows. Thanks to Glen at Jetsoft for contributing
this. To use the dll, include tessdll.h, import tessdll.lib and put tessdll.dll
somewhere where the system can find it. There is also a small dlltest program
to test the dll. Run with:
dlltest phototest.tif phototest.txt
It will output the text from phototest.tif with bounding box information.
*New for Windows* the distribution now includes tesseract.exe and tessdll.dll
which *might* work out of the box! There are no guarantees as you need
VC++6 versions of mfc and crt (at least) for it to work. (Batteries not
included, and certainly no installshield.)

*Important note for anyone building with make: i.e. anyone except devstudio
users*
This release includes new standardization for the data directory. To enable
Tesseract to find its data files, you must either:
=./configure=
=make=
=make install=
to move the data files to the standard place, or:
=export TESSDATA_PREFIX="directory in which your tessdata resides/"=
(or equivalent) in your .profile or whatever or setenv to set the environment
variable. Note that the directory must end in a /
*HAVING tesseract and tessdata IN THE SAME DIRECTORY DOES NOT WORK ANY MORE.*

*All users*
Fixed a bunch of name collisions - mostly with stl.
Made some preliminary changes for unicode compatibility. Includes a new data
file (unicharset) and renaming of the other data files to eng.* to support
different languages.
There are also several other minor bug fixes and portability improvements
for 64 bit, the latest visual studio compiler etc. Thanks to all who have
contributed these fixes.

NOTE: This is likely to be the last English-only release!
Apologies in advance to non-windows users for bloating the distribution with
windows executables. This will probably get fixed in the next release with
the multi-language capability, since that will also bloat the distribution.
