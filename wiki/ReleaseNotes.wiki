}}}

To train on a new language, see separate documentation.
More languages will be appearing over time.

List of changes in this release:

  * Fixed extern "C" declarations problem.
  * Made some improvements to consistency of accuracy across platforms.
  * Added vc++ express support.

==Instructions for downloading and building version 2.00.==
Things have changed quite a bit since the previous versions so please read carefully.

*All users*
The tarballs are split into pieces.

`tesseract-2.00.tar.gz` contains all the source code.

`tesseract-2.00.<lang>.tar.gt` contains the data files for <lang>. You need at least one
of these or tesseract will not work.

`tesseract-2.00.exe.tar.gz` is not for the 'exe' language. It is windows executables. They are built with VC++ express and come with absolutely no warranty. If they work for you then great, otherwise get visual C++ express (and the platform sdk) and build from the source.

*Non-windows users*
As with 1.04, this version works with make install. <br>
*New* there is a tesseract.spec for making rpms. (Thanks to Andrew Ziem for the help.)
It might work with your OS if you know how to do that sort of thing.

If you are linking to the libraries, as Ocropus does, there is now a single master
library called libtesseract_full.a.

Libtiff support should now be properly working via configure.

*Windows users*
If you are building from the sources, there are still dsw and dsp files for vc++6 and
also sln and vcproj files for vc++ express.

The dll has been updated to allow input of non-binary images. (Thanks to Glen of Jetsoft.)

Libtiff support can be added in either VC++6 or VC++express with the following:
{{{
Goto http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/tiff.htm
Download and run the setup program.
Add the paths for include and library files in tools/options/directories
Add HAVE_LIBTIFF to the preprocessor definitions.
Add libtiff.lib to the list of libraries.
Rebuild.
Make libtiff3.dll be in your path somewhere.
This is done by control panel/system/advanced/environment variables and adding c:/program files/gnuwin32/bin to PATH.
Keep your fingers crossed...
}}}

= Tesseract release notes May 15, 2007 - V1.04. =

*Windows users only*

Added a dll interface for windows. Thanks to Glen at Jetsoft for contributing
this. To use the dll, include tessdll.h, import tessdll.lib and put tessdll.dll
somewhere where the system can find it. There is also a small dlltest program
to test the dll. Run with:
{{{
dlltest phototest.tif phototest.txt
}}}
It will output the text from phototest.tif with bounding box information.

*New for Windows*

The distribution now includes tesseract.exe and tessdll.dll
which *might* work out of the box! There are no guarantees as you need
VC++6 versions of mfc and crt (at least) for it to work. (Batteries not
included, and certainly no installshield.)

*Important note for anyone building with make: i.e. anyone except devstudio
users*

This release includes new standardization for the data directory. To enable
Tesseract to find its data files, you must either:
{{{
./configure
make
make install
}}}
to move the data files to the standard place, or:
{{{
export TESSDATA_PREFIX="directory in which your tessdata resides/"
}}}
(or equivalent) in your .profile or whatever or setenv to set the environment
variable. Note that the directory must end in a /

*HAVING tesseract and tessdata IN THE SAME DIRECTORY DOES NOT WORK ANY MORE.*

*All users*

Fixed a bunch of name collisions - mostly with stl.
Made some preliminary changes for unicode compatibility. Includes a new data
file (unicharset) and renaming of the other data files to eng.* to support
different languages.
There are also several other minor bug fixes and portability improvements
for 64 bit, the latest visual studio compiler etc. Thanks to all who have
contributed these fixes.

NOTE: This is likely to be the last English-only release!
Apologies in advance to non-windows users for bloating the distribution with
windows executables. This will probably get fixed in the next release with
the multi-language capability, since that will also bloat the distribution.
