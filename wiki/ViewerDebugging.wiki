#summary How to use the Viewer to debug recognition.

= Introduction =

Tesseract has a built-in capability to display its internal state, so that you can view its segmentation and recognition.


= Building and installing =

The following components are required to run the viewer:
   * Java runtime
   * piccolo-1.2.jar
   * piccolox-1.2.jar
   * luajava-1.1.jar (version 2.03 and lower)
   * luajava-1.1.dll (windows only, version 2.03 and lower)
   * luajava-1.1.so  (linux only, version 2.03 and lower)
   * ScrollView.jar, built from the source in ocr-tesseract/java

The piccolo libraries are available from: http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/jazz/download/index.shtml

Version 2.03 and below also requires luajava:

Unfortunately, it is horribly slow, so it has been removed for 3.00. To make life easier, 2.04 will also not require it, but this change is not yet in svn.

All these jar files need to go in a single directory. Tesseract learns the location either through the environment variable SCROLLVIEW_PATH or a compiler define of the same name.
